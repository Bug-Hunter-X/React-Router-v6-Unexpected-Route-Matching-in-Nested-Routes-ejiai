This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves unexpected route matching that occurs when navigating to a parent route without a specific ID, causing the nested route to be activated even if the ID is missing.  The solution provided shows how to correctly structure the routes using the `useParams` hook to avoid this behavior.
